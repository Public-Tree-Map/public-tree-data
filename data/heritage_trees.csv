10942993,1,2016,"Moreton Bay Fig (Ficus macrophylla) trees are native to tropical Queensland and New South Wales, Australia. Ficus means "fig tree" and macrophylla refers to the species' large leaves. In open space, these spreading evergreen trees may have a canopy width of 150ft (46m) or more. They have large, dark, glossy green leaves in oval or oblong form, and figs that turn from green to purple in summer. Inside the figs are hundreds of tiny flowers, which are pollinated by the symbiotic fig wasp. The bark of these trees is smooth and pale gray, and darkens with age. Water usage is moderate. Affectionately dubbed "Morty," this Heritage tree is believed to be over 100 years old, the oldest in Tongva Park. Prior to 2013, Morty lived adjacent to a parking lot, which was demolished to build the city park. Morty is around 40-50ft (12-15m) high, with a canopy spread of approximately 80ft (24m). Due to a wide buttressed trunk, diameter at base height (DBH) is difficult to measure. There are several other excellent specimens of this species nearby. The largest Moreton Bay Fig tree still standing in California is in Santa Barbara, and the second largest is right here in Santa Monica, a City-commissioned Landmark Tree that stands in front of the Miramar Hotel.",
10927086,2,2016,"Metrosideros excelsus, or New Zealand Christmas trees, so named because they bloom bright scarlet during their native New Zealand's Christmas season, are coastal evergreen trees that generally grow to be around 80ft (24m) high, with a spreading, dome-like form. They are renowned for their brilliant red bottlebrush-like flowers, and have long, leathery, densely spaced leaves, which are glossy dark green and turn grayer on the lower surface with age. The bark of this tree is a rough, dark brown. Adventitious aerial roots often sprout from the trunks and woody stems of older trees.

The Maori, indigenous people of New Zealand, used the dense, strong wood of Metrosideros excelsus for ship building and tools for many centuries.

The New Zealand Christmas tree at the South end of Palisades Park, christened the Children's Tree of Life, was originally planted at a 1983 Earth Day peace celebration and was proclaimed a "living monument to world peace" by late Santa Monica Mayor Ken Edwards. Today it stands roughly 20ft (6m) tall with a canopy spread of 15ft (5m) and a diameter of 10in (35cm).

The tree was rededicated on its planting anniversary on April 22, 2013.",
10948575,3,2016,"Yate trees (Eucalyptus cornuta) originated in Western Australia. Eucalyptus means "well hidden" and cornuta means "horned," for the long, horn-like cap of the flower. These trees are evergreen with an open form and can grow to between 40ft and 70ft (12m-21m) high. They have round or oblong grey-green leaves and yellow-green or bright yellow flowers that appear in a cluster called an umbel (stalks of nearly equal length that spring from a common center). The bark of this tree is a light gray and relatively smooth.

The Yate in Goose Egg Park is approximately 90ft (27m) high with a 60ft (18m) canopy spread and a diameter of 45in (114cm). It is thought to be over 100 years old. Its unique aesthetics include a buttress and double leader.",
10948586,4,2016,"Erythrina caffra, commonly called Kaffirboom coral trees or Coast coral trees, usually top out around 40ft-60ft (12m-18m). They are deciduous with a spreading form, and are notable for their bright orange, broad and curved flower petals. The foliage of Kaffirboom coral trees is light green and consists of three leaflets, broadly ovate in shape. Their bark is gray and striated. These trees thrive in tropical environments like their native South Africa. Erythrina means "red" and caffra refers to the Kaffirs region of South Africa.

One of Santa Monica's most famous avenues is San Vicente Boulevard, due to the 156 Kaffirboom coral trees that line the median from Ocean Avenue to 26th St. They were originally planted in the 1950s, and the species has since been named the official tree of the City of Los Angeles.

The representative coral tree from the San Vicente median stands at approximately 25ft (8m) with a canopy width of 30ft (9m). The canopy spread may in fact be wider; the canopy has been pruned to the parkway width. The diameter at base height is 35in (89cm).

Santa Monica's Urban Forestry division, as part of a proactive management strategy, has been vigilant about replacing coral trees along San Vicente Boulevard in recent years to preserve the avenue's distinct beauty for future generations.",
